SUBJECT:

• Handle ’ (single quote) which should prevent the shell from interpreting the metacharacters in the quoted sequence.

• Handle " (double quote) which should prevent the shell from interpreting the metacharacters in the quoted sequence except for $ (dollar sign).

• Implement redirections:
◦ < should redirect input.
◦ > should redirect output.
◦ << should be given a delimiter, then read the input until a line containing the
delimiter is seen. However, it doesn’t have to update the history!
◦ >> should redirect output in append mode.

• Handle environment variables ($ followed by a sequence of characters) which
should expand to their values.

• Handle $? which should expand to the exit status of the most recently executed
foreground pipeline.
